# Footprint

Check it out [here](https://myfootprint.netlify.app/)!

## Objective
Before becoming a developer I spent 7 years working in the Environemtnal/Sustainability field and I always knew that I wanted to build a project that bridged both industries. That's where Footprint comes in - Footprint allows users to see their overall carbon footprint by logging their commutes. Users simply enter the starting/ending ZIP code, the method of transportation, and the number of passengers and Footprint uses that data to make an API call to [Klimaat](https://klimaat.app/) in order to calculate emmissions. Footprint allows users to get a better understand the environmental impact of their commute and how different modes of transportation can help minimze their carbon footprint and create a cleaner environment.

Footprint was built using Python/Flask/PostgreSQL for the server-side and React/JavaScript for the client-side.

** This project is part of a decoupled full stack application. The backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/hbarrons/footprint-back-end)

## Future Enhancements
- Add a page with emmission data for common activities in order to provide a larger context to each users Footprint
- Add input field for Commute Date
- Research API options to add exact addresses and public transportation option
- Dark Mode
- Populate Edit Footprint Form with current values
